    "about" :"Hi, I’m Manu — a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in frontend technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React**. I enjoy crafting clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces that not only look great but also provide seamless user experiences. Alongside my frontend skills, I’m exploring backend development using **Python** , **Node.js** and frameworks like **Flask** and **FastAPI** to build full-stack applications.\n\nRecently, I’ve started diving into Data Science and Machine Learning, where I blend code with analytics to create smart, AI-powered solutions. I believe in continuous learning and love turning creative ideas into practical digital products. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new tech trends, solving problems, or sharing knowledge with others.But also iam good at problem solving",
